   This menu item is active if one tests process with
polarized beams. This CalcHEP version allows to set 
polarization only for massless incoming particles. 
Entering the process one has to write the '%' symbol
after the particle which will be treated as polarized.  
  Helicity is defined as projection of particle spin 
on direction of motion. So, this parameter is changed 
in [-1,1] interval for spin 1 particles and in the 
[-0.5,0.5] interval for spin 1/2 particles.
By definition left handed particle has positive 
helicity. In general a value of helicity inside of 
interval means partial polarized beam. In particular 
unpolarized beam is characterized by zero helicity.
